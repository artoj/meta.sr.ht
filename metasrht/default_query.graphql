# Welcome to the SourceHut GraphQL explorer
# You can use this to run test requests against the GraphQL API
# To browse the GraphQL schema, use the "Schema" button on the far right.
# There's a sample query for you here; and more samples in other tabs.
query {
  # Fetch info about the authenticated user (you):
  me {
    # Grab their canonical name:
    canonicalName
    # And a list of their SSH keys:
    sshKeys {
      # This resource is paginated, so it has a cursor. If you pass this
      # value into sshKeys(cursor:"...") in a subsequent request, you'll
      # get the next page.
      cursor
      # These are the actual results.

  # notably, all write operations are presently unsupported.

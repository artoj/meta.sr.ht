{{! vim: set ft=email }}
Welcome to {{site-name}}, ~{{user.username}}! I'm {{owner-name}}, your
friendly neighborhood sysadmin. You can send me questions or feedback by
replying to this email, or emailing {{owner-email}} at any time. There's
a human being on the other end.

Here are a few resources you can use to get started:

Announcements list:		https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce
Community mailing list:		https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss
Documentation & tutorials:	https://man.sr.ht
IRC support & chat:		#sr.ht on irc.freenode.net

This is the only automated email you're going to get, so if you want to
get updates later, you'll have to subscribe to the sr.ht-announce list.
You can do this from your mail client by sending an email to
<~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce+subscribe@lists.sr.ht>, or visit the URL
above and click subscribe.

Also: payment is optional during the alpha, but be aware that it will
become mandatory later. This service is funded by its users, not by
investors. If you wish to support the alpha now, you can set up billing
here: https://meta.sr.ht/billing/initial

Thanks for signing up, and let me know if you need anything!

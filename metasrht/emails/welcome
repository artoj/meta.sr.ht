Welcome to sr.ht, ~{{user.username}}! I'm Drew, your friendly neighborhood
sysadmin.

If you're just getting started with sr.ht, you can learn more about how
to use the various services available here:

https://man.sr.ht

It contains detailed documentation on sr.ht, as well as tutorials for
getting started with each service.

During the alpha, payment is optional, but helps to support the service.
If you've already chosen to buy a subscription, thank you! If not,
you'll receive a follow-up email asking about it in 2 weeks, once you've
had a chance to evaluate the service a bit more. That'll be the last
unsolicited email you'll get from sr.ht, aside from normal account
maintenance sort of stuff.

Of course, if you want more emails, I post important announcements and a
monthly "what's new" to the sr.ht-announce mailing list:

https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce

You can subscribe to it without leaving your inbox by sending an email
to ~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce+subscribe@lists.sr.ht.

The sr.ht-discuss list is also a great place to send questions, feature
requests, announce your cool new project hosted on sr.ht, and start
discussions:

https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss

Have fun using sr.ht! Feel free to reply to this email if you have any
feedback or questions.

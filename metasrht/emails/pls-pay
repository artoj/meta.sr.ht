Hi ~{{user.username}}!

How are you enjoying sr.ht? If you have any feedback, please reply to
this email - there's a human being over here. As promised, I'm reaching
out again (and for the last time) to ask if you'll consider purchasing a
subscription.

sr.ht is funded entirely by its users and is only accountable to your
needs. The site you see today was built in my spare time over the course
of two years, but the income today is not far from being able to support
a full-time developer. The ability to work on sr.ht full-time would make
a huge difference in the pace at which the site matures, and it requires
support from users like you.

During the alpha, payment is optional. If you think sr.ht has earned
your subscription and you want to support the service, you can set up
billing here:

https://meta.sr.ht/billing

This is the last time you'll receive an automated email from me which
isn't for typical account maintenance. If you'd like to keep up to date
with news on sr.ht, you can opt-in by subscribing to the sr.ht-announce
mailing list:

https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce

You can subscribe to it without leaving your inbox by sending an email
to ~sircmpwn/sr.ht-announce+subscribe@lists.sr.ht.

If you're just getting started with sr.ht, you can learn more about how
to use the various services we have available at man.sr.ht, which was
recently redesigned to be more accessible and updated with tutorials to
ease you into the service:

https://man.sr.ht

The sr.ht-discuss list is also a great place to send questions, feature
requests, announce your cool new project hosted on sr.ht, and start
discussions:

https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss

Again, feel free to simply reply to this email to share your feedback
and questions with me. Thank you for using sr.ht!
